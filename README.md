## Glossary

**Normalization**

**Least Absolute Normalization (L1 Normalization)**

Makes sure that the sum of absolute values equals 1 in each row. This is better for datasets where you DON'T care about
the outliers.

**Least Squared Normalization (L2 Normalization)**

Makes sure that the sum of squared values equals 1 in each row. This is better for datasets where you DO care about
the outliers.
